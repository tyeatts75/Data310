Describe the following

(1) The data

- The data used originates from TensorFlowâ€™s iris dataset. This dataset contains 120 various flowers that can all be 
  split into three different classifications of iris. These three types of iris are setosa, versicolor,  and virginica. 
  There are also four features that make up the dataset: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. 
  The goal of the model we created with this dataset is to train a model to take those features and then assign 
  which type of iris the flower is most likely to be.

(2) How you created the tf.dataset

- 

(3) Describe the model itself, input shape, model architecture/layers and any functions (softmax/argmax)

- 

(4) Describe the process of training the model

- 

(5) Describe the optimizer used

- 

(6) Plot and describe the loss function over time

- 

(7) Describe evaluating the model w/ your test dataset

- 

(8) Make some predictions
