## Monday (8/2) Response (Abstract)

(1) Presentation Title:

- Predicting Student Success 

(2) Abstract First Draft

- 	I have chosen to pursue trying to create a model that can help determine how likely a student will be to need 
     additional assistance or tutoring based on their characteristics. To explore this I found a dataset on Kaggle that 
     has information on 2,133 different students. The target variable within this dataset is the student’s end-of-year 
     post-test score. The dataset also contains ten different features, ranging from the type of school the student 
     is enrolled in, to information specific to the student. This information can be used to train a model that can 
     predict a student’s post-test score, which will allow school systems to have the ability to predict how well each 
     student will score and have the opportunity to try and give them extra help. I will train the model using feature 
     columns to train a continuous target model. I’ll then experiment with different combinations of the various 
     features to create the best model possible.


- Breakdown of Data

    - 2,133 Students within Dataset
    
    - 10 Features:
      
        - School
          
        - School Setting

            - Public or Non-public
          
        - Classroom
          
            - I'm unsure has so what these features mean
          
        - Teaching Method
          
            - Standard or Experimental
          
        - Student ID
          
        - Gender
          
        - Lunch
          
            - Does not qualify or Qualifies for reduced/free lunch
          
        - Pretest
          
            - Score student got on pretest assessment 
    
    - Target is Student Post-Test Score
    
        - Range of 32% to 100%
