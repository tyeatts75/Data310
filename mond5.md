## Monday (8/2) Response (Abstract)

(1) Research Question and Dataset

- The research question I have chosen to pursue is to figure out what traits contribute to making a country
the happiest. To explore this I found a dataset on Kaggle that has information on 156 different countries. Each country
  has a target variable, which is their World Happiness Report Score, and then features such as economic production, 
  social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.
